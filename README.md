### 🧭 About Me

I build and lead **data systems that think in relationships** — graphs, not tables.

After two decades designing analytics architectures inside the federal government,  
I now focus on **GraphVentures**, an applied R&D venture exploring  
graph-native and multimodal approaches to entity resolution.

My work blends:
- **Graph-centric reasoning** — structure-aware learning and retrieval
- **Entity resolution** — probabilistic and visual linking at massive scale
- **Pragmatic ML systems** — from prototype to reproducible, operational pipelines

This space exists mostly to share **proof-of-concept work** —  
things I build to explore ideas, validate methods, or explain a concept to others.  
If the code runs, it’s because the idea matters, not because I’m trying to ship a package.

> I build where the messy, human parts of data meet the rigor of mathematics.

## 🧠 Current Focus — GraphVentures

**GraphVentures** is a small, experimental research venture focused on advancing **visual and multimodal entity resolution.**  
Our goal is to connect visual, textual, and structured representations in a way that’s interpretable, verifiable, and graph-native.

**Recent research directions**
- Image-to-graph pipelines linking photos of individuals across time  
- Bayesian and constraint-based graph matching  
- Graph-native RAG: retrieval grounded in relationships, not just vectors  
- GPU-accelerated entity linking experiments (cuGraph + PGVector)

**Status:** stealth-stage; early collaborations with archival and analytic partners.  
**Focus:** patent-backed hybrid methods and small, interpretable AI.

## 🧩 Public Repositories

These are small, reproducible projects that showcase how I work: measured, interpretable, and grounded in physical data.

### 🧊 [HVAC_ZoneAnalytics](https://github.com/joesweetsox/HVAC_ZoneAnalytics)
Python tools for analyzing **IoT weather sensors** and modeling **multi-zone HVAC dynamics**.  
Used for residential thermal efficiency research and cycle detection.


---
#### ⛵ [SailingTrack](https://github.com/joesweetsox/SailingTrack)
Library + CLI for analyzing GPX tracks and producing **interactive maps**  
with speed overlays and Chesapeake Bay navigation markers.

> Both projects are examples of **physical systems analysis** —  
> how structured relationships and time-series dynamics can be modeled, measured, and visualized.

### Philosophy

> “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.  
> If you can’t explain it, you shouldn’t automate it.”
