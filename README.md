### 🧭 About Me

I design and build **AI/ML systems that think in relationships** — graphs, not grids.  
After 20+ years leading national-scale analytics programs, I founded **[GraphVentures](#)** to explore **graph-native and multimodal approaches to entity resolution**, connecting structured data, text, and imagery into unified, explainable knowledge networks.

My work blends:
- **Graph-centric reasoning** — structure-aware learning and retrieval
- **Entity resolution** — probabilistic and visual linking at massive scale
- **Pragmatic ML systems** — from prototype to reproducible, operational pipelines

> I build where the messy, human parts of data meet the rigor of mathematics.

## 🧠 Current Focus — GraphVentures

**GraphVentures** is a small, experimental research venture focused on advancing **visual and multimodal entity resolution.**  
Our goal is to connect visual, textual, and structured representations in a way that’s interpretable, verifiable, and graph-native.

**Recent research directions**
- Image-to-graph pipelines linking photos of individuals across time  
- Bayesian and constraint-based graph matching  
- Graph-native RAG: retrieval grounded in relationships, not just vectors  
- GPU-accelerated entity linking experiments (FAISS + cuGraph + PGVector)

**Status:** stealth-stage; early collaborations with archival and analytic partners.  
**Focus:** patent-backed hybrid methods and small, interpretable AI.

## 🧩 Public Repositories

These are small, reproducible projects that showcase how I work: measured, interpretable, and grounded in physical data.

### 🧊 [WeatherStation](https://github.com/joesweetsox/WeatherStation)
Python tools for analyzing **IoT weather sensors** and modeling **multi-zone HVAC dynamics**.  
Used for residential thermal efficiency research and cycle detection.

**Highlights**
- Ecowitt API integration (real + historical data)  
- Derivative-based heating/cooling detection  
- Zone coupling and entropy profiling  
- Bias correction between rooms and sensors  
- Example notebooks and plots  

> *Explores how physical systems reveal structure when treated like a graph.*

### ⛵ [SailingTrack](https://github.com/joesweetsox/SailingTrack)
Library + CLI to analyze GPX tracks and generate **interactive maps** with color-coded speeds and Chesapeake Bay navigation marks.

**Highlights**
- Parse GPX and compute distance, speed, bearing  
- Generate interactive **Folium** maps with speed overlays  
- MRSA and Chesapeake markers built-in  
- Export enriched metrics and segment statistics  
- Supports sailing, cycling, and metric modes  

> *Originally built to visualize race performance — now a neat geospatial analytics sandbox.*

## 🧩 How I Work

1. Start with the decision you’re trying to inform  
2. Prototype the smallest measurable truth  
3. Measure → refine → scale only what matters  
4. Make it interpretable and maintainable  

> “If the team can’t explain it and the execs can’t act on it, it’s not done.”
